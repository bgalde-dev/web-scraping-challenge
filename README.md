# Web Scraping Challenge
This challenge was to use our knowledge of webscraping a website for various sorts of data, 
placing that data in a database, retriving that data to a flask app which template uses bootstrap.
This maybe condsidered our first full stack project.

## Files to be aware of
* This project does use Flask so needs to be run via the [app.py](/mission-to-mars/app.py)
* It also uses a config file you will need to copy the [config_sample.py](/mission-to-mars/config_sample.py) 
rename to config.py and set your own MongoDB database connection string.
* The jupyter notebook [mission_to_mars.ipynb](/mission-to-mars/mission_to_mars.ipynb) can be run through VS Code or a notebook server.
